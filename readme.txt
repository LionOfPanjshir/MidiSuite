**Instructions on how to best test the current version of application**

-The main method is in the file MidiSuite.java

-Run the application; click on Help->Guide, and instructions will be output the
text area

-If your system has a soundbank, you should see a list of instruments populated in
the Midi Instruments combobox, as well as a list of available channels.

-Change instruments to change the sound of the piano.

-If no instruments are loaded, your system may not have a soundbank; try on another system.

-Keys 'Z' though '/' play the bottom ten white notes notes
-The corresponding black keys can be played using the keys above,
for example, 'S' and 'D' play the black keys above the three white
keys 'Z', 'X', and 'C', and so forth.

*If you hear no sound, check to make sure there are no other
programs running or that were running prior that may have not
freed up default MIDI system resources. You may have to wait for the upcoming version
for this to work on your computer


***UPDATES ADDED***
-The keyboard has now been mapped using key bindings to connect keyboard keys
to piano keys (the previous version used key listeners, which are not well suited
for this program)

-Change instrument functions

-Change channel functions

-System MIDI Device Information

-Status and information text area


***CHALLENGES***

-The record functionality is limited and at times doesn't work properly.
-After recording, click stop, then play. You may have to wait a moment for playback.

-Most of these issues arise from asynchronous MIDI devices. Specifically:

-The Sequencer records MidiEvents. Each MidiEvent contains information about what is
happening, for example, the note that is turned on, the velocity of the note, the duration
the note was played, and perhaps most importantly, a timestamp measured in ticks.

-The Sequencer measures MidiEvents by a tick value, which is dependent on the tempo

-The notes are generated by the Synthesizer, which produces a timestamp measures in
microseconds, not ticks.

-Because of these differences, the MidiEvent tick value is not currently 
obtained in a synchronous manner with the Synthesizer, which uses a microsecond timestamp.

-This issue may take time to be fixed.
